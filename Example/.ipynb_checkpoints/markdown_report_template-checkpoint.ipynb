    "This document is a template for academic writing, science notebook records and reports. It is written in the Markdown format: it’s plain text, human-readable, and can easily be translated into other formats. It allows to write easily structured text with figures, mathematical formulas and bibliographic references without bothering about formatting. One of the biggest advantage is that by separating writing from formatting, I can keep a single source file in a lightweight text format and generate several different output documents in an automatic fashion. These output, for the moment, are: i) a PDF document generated by LaTeX, ii) a stand-alone HTML with integrated images and iii) a Wordpress post on my personal website.\n",

As mentionned in the [documentation](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html#LaTeX-equations), jupyter uses MathJax to render latex, however with some limitations that are not reported in the documentation. \n",

Thus, \\$20,000 and \\$30,000 won’t parse as math. If for some reason you need to enclose text in literal \\$ characters, backslash-escape them and they won’t be treated as math delimiters.\n",

    "\n",
    "[QuickLatex](http://www.holoborodko.com/pavel/quicklatex/) supports many Latex features, as AMS math, and also custom preamble, which makes it very powerful. Also, all equations are rendered as SVG images, which display crisp at every zooming scale. Because all equations are rendered once and included as SVG images in the post, the load on the client browser is null resulting in fast download and display of the webpage, unlike MathJax script. The supported latex tags are the same as for MathJax:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ inline math `\\( ... \\)` (`$ ... $` is also supported but is deactivated on my wordpress installation!).\n",
    "+ display math `\\[ ... \\]` and `$$ ... $$`\n",
    "+ math environments: `equation`, `align`, `displaymath`, `eqnarray`, `multline`, `flalign`, `gather`, and `alignat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: unfortunately quicklatex is parsing inside `<code></code>` block. This is why double dollar syntax was getting displayed as latex display equation with dots `...` inside. This could happend quite often when printing inline code with regex with escaped parenthesis, for example `re.sub(r'\\(test\\)', r'\\1', \"string\")`. There is no problem in seperate code block because these get in a `pre` block, which QuickLatex does not parse. Solution is to enclose inline code in a `span` tag with `crayon-inline` class, which will enable basic syntax highlighting while preventing any latex parser to mess with it: `<span class=\"decode:true crayon-inline\">re.sub(r'\\(test\\)', r'\\1', \"string\")</span>`{.html}.\n",
    "\n",

    "re.sub(r'$$abc$$', r'a$$abcd$$', string) = \"this should not be parsed as latex expression\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have to choose one particular syntax for inline and block code, because there is no standard in html5 about how to do that. People either use specific tags: `<codeblock>`, `<code>`{.html}, or the more general `<pre>` tag with class attribute that defines if the code is inline or in block. The Crayon plugin for syntax highlighting that I use on the wordpress site prefers 1) for code block the `<pre class=\"lang:python\">` tag with the class defining the language, and 2) for inline code the `<span class=\"lang:python decode:true  crayon-inline \">` tag with the class giving the language attribute and the `crayon-inline` attribute which defines to insert the code inline.
